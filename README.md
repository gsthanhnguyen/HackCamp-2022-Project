## Inspiration
<p>We were inspired to make this project as this was our first hackathon! We wanted to create something that could ultimately help people in some time of way, and we came up with this idea!<br></p>

## What it does
<p> The website is survey that links you to dietary supplements based off your health concerns. Those concerns could be energy metabolism, bad sleep cycles, or immunity!<br></p>

## How we built it
<p>This website was built primarily using css, javscript, and html.</p>

## Challenges we ran into
<p>One of our biggest challenges we ran into was learning how to use flex boxes to make the appearance of our website more appealing, and learning how to save answers to the survey in stored values.</p>

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we got this running, and had some cool transitions in it too!

## What we learned
<p>We learned that even though coding is a hassle to do, you have a lot of fun doing it; especially when the code works!</p>

## What's next for Snazzy Supplements
<p>TBA</p>

## Built With
<p> CSS, HTML, Javascript
